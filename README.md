# Finished-programs
Samples of programs I've finished while studying software-engineering

For assembly:

1. A program which converts an .asm file into a readable, highlighted .html file. (asm_to_html.asm)
2. A disassembler. (disasm.asm)

For C++:

1. A therapy clinic simulation, currently usable to check whether it is more profitable to hire group therapists or individual therapists depending on the input of patients. (Simulation)
2. A weighted job scheduling algorithm with inputs of time, deadline and penalty. Print the sequence of jobs to minimize the penalty. (WeightedJobScheduling)

For Java:

1. A simple dijkstra implementation to find the shortest distance in a graph between two cities. (ShortestPath.java)
